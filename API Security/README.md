# API
- The API is the middleman that handles requests and delivers responses. E.g. in a restaurant, give your order to a waiter (the API), who brings back your food. 


## Key Components of API

- Request – What you're asking for (e.g., "get user data")
- Response – What comes back (e.g., the actual user data)
- Endpoint – The specific URL you call (e.g., /users/123)
- Methods – The action type: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove)

## Why APIs Matter

- Let different systems communicate without knowing each other's internal workings
- Enable apps to use external services (payments, maps, weather)
- Allow controlled access to data and functionality

## Example
- Weather app on your phone calls a weather service's API. The API returns forecast data, and your app displays it—without needing to know how the weather service functions internally.
